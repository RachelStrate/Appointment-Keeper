# Appointment-Keeper
This project looks at a dataset of 100k+ medical appointments from the city of Vitoria, Brazil to try and understand why 20% of appointments are missed. The original data set

This notebook specifically looks at the appointment details and the scholarships, answering the below questions.

Appointment Details - How do the appointment details influence arrivals?
To answer the main question, I looked into the below three sub-questions.
  Does the appointment day of the week influence arrival?
  Are the SMS reminders effective? And what if compared to the appointment day?
  Does an increase in waiting time affect the arrival?

Scholarships - How do scholarships influence arrivals?
To answer the main question, I investigated the below two sub-questions.
  Do the people receiving the stipend arrive to appointments more often than non-recipients?
  Are the neighbourhoods with a high percentage of no-shows inhabited by fewer scholarship recipients?
